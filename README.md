This is a starting point for my playing around with machine learning (reinforcement learning, deep learning) with Tensorflow via `keras` and `python-sc2` that I did a while back and want to resurrect at some point.

I've removed the training data and example code for now, but the starting point for getting this working again would be: https://pythonprogramming.net/starcraft-ii-ai-python-sc2-tutorial/

This is using [python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2) - but may need fixing to work with latest.

Everything under "examples" has been taken from python-sc2 package - currently just used as a test opponent.
